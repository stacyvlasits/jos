This repo will track the progress of the JOSHU project.

All of the codebase I'd been working on is located here: https://github.com/philIip/jos

I completed updating one quiz to a new template. It is located here: https://github.com/philIip/jos/blob/master/kana/hiragana/hira_q/hq_a-n_audio.php. I rewrote the JavaScript for this template, located in /js/kana-quiz.js
You can see the new quiz style here: http://wikis.la.utexas.edu/sta/blog/joshu-quiz. This new template should be able to cover a wide array of the quizzes. However, all the grading is still done on the client side, so any student with the knowledge of HTML could very easily cheat.

Other "big" changes:
The new header is located in /header.php
All of the CSS for the new design is located in /css/style.css, including the responsiveness
The accordion navigation I wrote is located in /js/script.js

It's been a pleasure working on this project! Thanks for giving me the opportunity to do so. I hope you all have a wonderful summer!
